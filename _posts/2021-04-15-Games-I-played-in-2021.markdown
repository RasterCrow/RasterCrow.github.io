# Info

Having all these platforms and launchers to play from, when the end of the year draws near I tend to forget which games I played, so I decided to use a blog post as a tracker for all the games that I played, in this case in 2021.
When I have time I'm gonna add some notes at the end of the page for some games that I need to talk about, or some standalone blog posts.

`Note : I'm only gonna write down singleplayer games.`
