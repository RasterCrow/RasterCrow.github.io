Recently I decided to try to give more importance to the Blog section of the site.
This is because, with all the free time I had, I have worked on several projects with the `Raspberry Pi 4`,` React`, `Docker` and I'd like to talk about them in a few posts.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/rastercrow.me/images/posts/8-6-20/oldStylePost.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="old Style Blog" max-width="600" max-height="338" />

With the old blogging system, visible above, it was very fast and easy to switch from one post to another, as clicking on one of them did not redirect you to a specific page, but simply opened a popup tab with the content of the post.
I liked this system and still like it a lot, because it allowed the user to have everything on the same page.
But due to the way it is implemented, it is not possible to post direct links to that post and also not even a search on the internet with information from the post would have given me any results.
I therefore decided, instead of loading the post in the modal directly on the page, to send the user to the blog apge, like in all the normal blogs.
This also allows me to do things like collections of posts from a certain category, or a certain month. (Not available at the moment).

I know that by using services like `WordPress` or `Wiz` I could have done this much faster, but I wanted to do something different and try to develop it myself.

Thanks for reading, see you next time!

_P.S : Yes, it is ok that the post cards are of different sizes, I made this design choice on purpose._
