I recently purchased `Death Stranding` on the Steam store, the latest work from `Hideo Kojima`.

For those unfamiliar with the game, Death Stranding is a very peculiar videogame with the journey of the player at its heart.\
It was therefore very important to design the map in such a way to push the player to explore and try new things while still being interactable and aesthetically pleasing to the eye.\
It obviously helped the team at Kojima Productions to have the `Decima Engine`, previously used for `Horizon Zero Dawn`, which recently came out on the [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/), that allowed them to really push the hardware capabilities of the PS4 with advanced character models and landscapes that look like real-life pictures.

The inclusion of a Photo Mode has therefore allowed many fans of the title and also real photographers to have fun trying to capture the best moments this game has to offer.

Speaking of the Photo Mode per se, the most limiting factor I encountered must be the anchored camera around the player, which can be hidden if you want to capture only landscapes, but still, I would have preferred something more like the `Shadow of the Tomb Raider` photo mode where you could move anywhere around Lara Croft's character within a certain distance.\
Also, a little gem, you can even activate the mode during game cutscenes but you obviously can't move the camera around.

Even with these limitation, there are however a number of options that can be used such as settings for the `depth of field`, `wide angle` camera, `poses` for Sam and BB and also some pre-made `filters`, which with some imagination allows players to take some very nice pictures.

During my trip through America I had the opportunity to use this mode several times so here are some pictures I took.

Thank you for your time, see you next.
